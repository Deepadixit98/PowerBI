# Scatter Plots
  These plots are used to identify the correlation between 2 variables.
  

# First Visual - 
--> In the visualization
    Y-axis = GDP per capita
    X-axis = Score
    Legend = Continent
    values = Country
    
    **Eventually, the scatter pot shows the summation of any numerical 
     Variable.
     So, We put the country to the values in visualization to see the 
     country-wise GDP per capita vs. Score.
     
    Tooltips = Overall rank, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life 
               choices
   
    **Tooltips are used to see the information according to various 
      variables but those variables do not affect the scatter plot i.e.   
      scatterplot does not react to the variation related to variables in
      tooltips. 
      That is the scatterplot does not react to --> Overall rank, Healthy 
      life expectancy, and Freedom to make life choices.
                  
    Play-axis = used for timeline-based outputs e.g.- a monthly report.
                can play the scatter plot like a music player or video
		player.
                let's say we take the continent as the play axis of the 
                scatter will be played as per continent.   

  

# Second Visual - 
--> In the visualization
    Y-axis = Perceptions of corruption
    X-axis = Freedom to make life choices
    values = Country
    
-->In the Brush (Format) 
    Zoom slider --> turn on 
	* you can slide up and down on Y-axis and slide right and left on	  X-axis and 

    Markers --> shape --> Type = diamond
    Markers --> Color --> Blue(default) 
    Markers --> Color --> fx (conditional formatting)
          fx (conditional formatting)--> default Color- Markers Will pop up 
             Format style = Gradient
             What field should we base this on? = Sum of GDP per capita
             Summarization = sum
             How should we format empty values? = Don't Format
	     Minimum =Lowest value (Red)
	     Centre  =Middle value (grey) 
 	     Maximum =Highest value(Green)
             OK
             
    * Legend overrides conditional formatting.
    * If you remove Legend conditional formatting will be retained.
    * Legend has given more importance over conditional formatting.
   


# Third Visual - 
-->In the visualization
    Y-axis = Social support
    X-axis = Generosity

	It may be possible that the single-country data can be repeated.
	You want to present data with the help of actual numbers.
	
	**Eventually, the scatter pot shows the summation of any numerical 
        Variable.
        
	So, for plotting the Graph without summation and using actual -    	values.
 	
	Go to visualization -->
	--> right click on Generosity
	--> Choose Don't Summarize
	--> right click on Social support
	--> Choose Don't Summarize


 
# Fourth Visual - Clustering
--> In the visualization -->
    Y-axis = Sum of Healthy life expectancy
    X-axis = Sum of Freedom to make life choices

    values = Country    (Automatically appears in Legend filed 
     after clustering)  

    Legend = Freedom vs. Health  (Automatically appears in Legend filed 
     after clustering)      

	* clustering is basically a method of grouping. called bucketing.
	
	* We can do clustering over every numerical field --> (Try right-	  click on any numerical field.) 
	
    
	* BY clicking 3 dots at the upper right corner of the visual 	  	  	--> Automatically find cluster 
		-->Clusters Table pops up 
		Name = Freedom vs. Health
		Field = Country
		Description = ...Blank
		Number of clusters = 3

	* 3 Clusters will be visible in the fourth chart
.	* Ken's Method for Clustering.
	* automatically a physical field named Freedom vs. Health will be 	   visible in the data Box.
	* Waffle icon before that physical field.

	* Click on the Waffle icon --> Edit cluster 
	--> Rename Cluster 1 = H  i.e High
		   Cluster 2 = M  i.e Middium
		   Cluster 3 = L  i.e Low
	--> OK
            the colors and name of cluster gets changed.


# Fifth Visual - Map
--> In the visualization -->
	values = Country 
	Legend = Freedom vs. Health
   
	* Location wise clustering will be shown.
	
 

# We are done with WHR and Continent dataset so we can hide them 
 In Data Box --> Hover on the table WHR and Continent  --> Right-click     
   --> Hide 
You can see these datasets in the Data View as well as Model View, They will be hidden in the report view only.
