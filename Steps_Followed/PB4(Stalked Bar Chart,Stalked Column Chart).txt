# Data set Used = Sample
 
# First Visual - Stalked Bar Chart
--> In the visualization
    Y-axis = Product
    X-axis = Sum of Profit, Sum of Discounts
    
-->In the Brush (Format) 
    Data labels --> turn on  (Shows numbers on beam )
    Total labels --> turn on (Shows numbers on axes )
		 --> Values -->Value decimal places = 1
    X-axis --> turn off 
	* as the labels on no need of axis values.


# Second Visual - Stalked Column Chart
--> In the visualization
    X-axis = Discount Band
    Y-axis = Sum of  Sales
    Legend = Year

-->In the Brush (Format) 
    Data labels --> turn on 
    Total labels --> turn on
    Y-axis --> turn off
	* as the labels on no need of axis values.

When we take the StalkedBar Chart, the visualisation shows that the first field is for the Y-axis and the second is for the X-axis.

In contrast with the Stalked Column Chart, the visualisation shows that the first field is for the X-axis and the second is for the Y-axis.

So basically, PowerBI always suggests the first field for textual data i.e. catagorical data and the Second field for Numerical data.
