Intro to the PowerBI Interface  -

** views Interfaces -
1. Report view -
   To see the final result.

2. Data view -
   To see the actual structure of the data we are dealing with.

3. Model view - 
   You can see all the model connections/ relationships in the table.

** Get Data - 
 - The most important tab that comes under the Home section is "Get Data" 
it lets you pull the data from various sources.
for example -  Excel Workbooks, Power BI datasets, SQL Servers, Web, etc.

- By clicking on the "Get Data Button" you can see more options like PDF, text CSV, excel, JSON, azure databases, SQL databases, and many many more.


 - Whatever outside the dotted line is free selection or scrap area.
Nothing can be created in this area.
Used to deselect.


Tabs - 
1. Filter tab - 
   All the filters(needed to manipulate data) are available. 

2. Visualization Tab - 
   Contains many visuals to represent the data.

3. Data View tab -  
   The data we are dealing with can be seen here.



**Steps we went Through**

On the dashboard, we had 4 options - import data from Excel, import data from SQL Server, Paste data into a blank table, and Try sample data.

#step 1 = clicked on Try a sample data --> Load sample data--> It opens Navigator and shows two sample datas --> We chose Sheet1 -->   


To better understand the data, use data view and scroll down for different columns to see what unique values that are present in each.


note - the majority of we will be working with the 3 data types that are - Text, Number and Date.


# In the data tab/ block

a. some data is shown by a sigma icon, they are numerical fields.
 
b. some data is shown by the calendar icon, they are date fields. 
 Date - (Power BI is smart enough to club this date in the various features.)
        In the report view, it can be seen with a hierarchy like- year, quarter, month and day. So, you can extract granular info from the date field.      

c. some data is shown by NO icon, they are Text fields.



#step 2 = renamed sheet Page 1 as Chart 1, renamed Data "Sheet 1" to "Sample"

 

# First Visual - Bar plot

created the bar plot by dragging profit and product columns from the data block and dropping those into the work area, giving a product(X-axis) wise profit(Y-axis). moved the bar plot to the upper left corner with the cursor.
 
--> In the visualization
    Y-axis = Sum of Profit
    X-axis = Product
  

# Second Visual - Map

--> In the visualization
    Location = Country
    Bubble Size = Sum of  Sales
    Tooltips = Sum of Profit (do not affect the visual.)

we have a Country column i.e. geolocation
--> dragged and dropped county on the dashboard --> shows map 
--> Drag sales and drop on the map 
-- the map(visual) shows the location-wise sales. 


**Bigger the circle greater the sales are.

**Visuals on the same page are interconnected.  
if you click on any attribute on any of the visuals it triggers the other visuals also.

**To make sales value readable, we formatted the sales with a comma separator-

-->clicked on the sales in data-block 
-->changed forma to decimal points =0  
-->clicked on comma separator  


# Third Visual -table form

** Whenever information cannot be categorised, it is simply represented in tabular format i.e. columns are not related to each other = Zero Co-relation. 

--> In the visualization
    Columns = Segment, Gross Sales, Discounts, Profit. 
    

-->Renamed column names in the visualization block
-->formatted the table grid with global font size to larger.



# Fourth Visual -Pie chart

--> In the visualization
    Legends = Discount Band
    Values = Sum of Profit

taken Discount band as legend--> 

**Legend - whichever column is chosen as a legend provides the colour scheme that represents the better understanding of that column.
