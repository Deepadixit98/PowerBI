let's see, how?

* If we put Date --> Date hierarchy-->Year in the Columns of Table and Matrix.
 *The table shows the report one below the other but the matrix shows one beside the other.


$ MEASURES


*Measure gets calculated at a higher level of data, it does not get calculated on a Physical level. 
*Not doing a calculation at the line item level. keeping it in the memory. Only visible at the report level.  

####Steps
--> Click on any of the column names --> New Measure or Click on the New measure From the ribbon Home Tab.

	* Gives sales per distinct customer.


--> Click on any of the column names --> New Measure or Click on the New measure From the ribbon Home Tab.
--> Go to Formula bar --> Write >> M_Premium_Sales = CALCULATE([M_Gross1] , Sales[C_Cust Type] = "Premium")--> press enter
	* New measure M_Premium_Sales  got created.

* let's add M_Premium_Sales to the table to get the total sales for the premium customer.

similarly, follow the flow for following measures -->

M_Premium&Mobile_Sales = CALCULATE([M_Gross] , Sales[C_Cust Type] = "Premium" && Sales[C_Buz Seg] ="Mobile" )

M_Walkin_Sales = CALCULATE([M_Gross] , Sales[C_Cust Type] = "Regular" || Sales[C_Cust Type] = "Standard")
