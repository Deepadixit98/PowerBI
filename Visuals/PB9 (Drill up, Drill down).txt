	arrow buttons are present.

      	* It is a storyline visual - that responds to the actions.

--> Drill down	
	* If you click on the year 2014 beam after clicking on "Drill down" 
	  it further shows the Quarterly report if you again "Drill down" 	  
	  the quarterly it will show the Monthly report.

	* If you click on the product 4.8M after clicking on "Drill down" 
	  it further shows the Country report for that particular product i.e. 4.8M 
	  --> If you again "Drill down" on the Country, it will show the Discount Band report for that particular product. 
          --> If you again "Drill down" on Dicount Band, it will show you in which segment the Dicount Band is.
